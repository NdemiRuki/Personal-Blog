      <h1>My First Week At Refactory.</h1>

<p> My first week of software development at refactory was great. This was not the first time I was learning about the internet, however, it was a good refresher.Samson went indepth on Software 
    engineering and what a software engineer does. How they are able to build a successful software development team and how to build software.  </p>
    <p>What I picked from these classes in the first week is that when creating software there is more to it than just writing code. It usually takes more than one mind to create a software, 
        therefore, working as a team is more ideal to attain the best results. As a team you need to come up with a budget. This budget would entail the following: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How much to pay each team member?</li>
        <li>How much time and complexity is involved?</li>
        <li>What tools and services do you need to pay for or subscribe to?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's talk about building a good software engineering team. Good software development teams don't fall from trees. It's not easy building a software engineering team. The difference between a good and great team is how confident 
        the members are in themselves to achieve the best version of their project. What I learnt from Samson in the first week is that a software engineering team comprises of many different branches. For example, There are business analysts
        that gather gather requirements and process flows. Other branches include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UI/UX Designer - that create mock-ups and prototypes.</li>
            <li>Frontend team - that convert the mockups to actual UI + Functionality</li>
            <li>Backend team - that write the logic, via APIs or via monolithic application </li>
            <li>DevOps team - build the infrastructure, deal with servers, buying domain, points, setting up testing and stagings and all that stuff. And maintain and monitor the application.</li>
        </ul>
