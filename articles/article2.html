      <h1>My Second Week At Refactory.</h1>
<p>In my second week at refactory I learned about Version control. Version control is is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help 
    software teams manage changes to source code over time. This ties in to week 1 because as a team it is more efficient to use version control to keep track, monitor and make changes to the project when using version control.
    This in part helps the team achieve the best version of their project as it cuts down on the time looking and searching for changes that could have caused problems at a later stage. An example of version control would be GitHub. 
    GitHub allows you to put your work on a remote repository which can be refered to by fellow team members when changes need to be made to the code. You can also find examples of similar projects online on public repositories that can help you when you're stuck or to improve your project in whatever way you see fit.</p>    
   <p>Samson also introduced us to HTML & CSS. HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS and scripting languages such as JavaScript. He showed us the basics of HTML and how to use it to create websites. HTML is so relevant that
     it is the language I am currently using to write this blog that you see. Also, CSS is what I am using to style this blog to make it look as presentable as it does. CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology 
     of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>
